Yes, it is possible to synchronize and publish notebooks made in Kaggle with GitHub. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. Export Notebook from Kaggle
    - Open your notebook in Kaggle.
    - Click on the "File" menu at the top left.
    - Select "Download" and then choose the format you want (usually .ipynb for Jupyter notebooks).

2. Push Notebook to GitHub
    - Go to your GitHub repository where you want to upload the notebook.
    - If the repository doesn't exist, create a new one by clicking the "New" button on your GitHub homepage and follow the instructions.
    - Once inside your repository, click on "Add file" and select "Upload files".
    - Drag and drop your downloaded notebook (.ipynb file) or click to select it from your file system.
    - Add a commit message and click on "Commit changes".

Automating the Process

To automate the synchronization between Kaggle and GitHub, you can use GitHub Actions or a CI/CD pipeline. Here's a basic outline using GitHub Actions:

1. Create a GitHub Action Workflow:
    - In your GitHub repository, go to the "Actions" tab.
    - Click on "New workflow".
    - Choose "set up a workflow yourself".
2. Add Workflow YAML File:
    ```
    name: Sync Kaggle Notebooks

    on:
      schedule:
        - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Runs daily at midnight
      workflow_dispatch:

    jobs:
      sync:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - name: Checkout repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Setup Python
          uses: actions/setup-python@v2
          with:
            python-version: 3.x

        - name: Install kaggle
          run: pip install kaggle

        - name: Download Kaggle notebook
          env:
            KAGGLE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.KAGGLE_USERNAME }}
            KAGGLE_KEY: ${{ secrets.KAGGLE_KEY }}
          run: kaggle kernels pull <KAGGLE_USERNAME>/<NOTEBOOK_NAME> -p .

        - name: Commit and push changes
          run: |
            git config --global user.name 'github-actions[bot]'
            git config --global user.email 'github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com'
            git add .
            git commit -m "Update Kaggle notebooks"
            git push
    ```

Set Kaggle API Credentials:
- Go to the settings of your GitHub repository.
- Under the "Secrets and variables" section, click on "Actions".
- Add two new repository secrets: KAGGLE_USERNAME and KAGGLE_KEY with your Kaggle API credentials.
